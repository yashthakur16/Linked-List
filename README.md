Singly Linked List Implementation in C++
This repository contains a simple implementation of a singly linked list in C++. It provides basic functionalities such as insertion at the head, insertion at the tail, insertion at a specific position, and deletion at a specific position.

Functionalities
1. Insert at Head
You can insert a new element at the beginning of the linked list using the inserthead function.

2. Insert at Tail
You can insert a new element at the end of the linked list using the inserttail function.

3. Insert at Position
You can insert a new element at a specific position in the linked list using the insertmiddle function. If the specified position is greater than the length of the list, the element will be inserted at the tail.

4. Delete at Position
You can delete an element at a specific position in the linked list using the deleteatposition function. If the specified position is out of bounds, no deletion will occur.

5. Print Linked List
The print function is used to print the elements of the linked list.
